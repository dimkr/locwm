## Overview

locwm is a [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/) port of [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/)'s *cwm*.

It's a lightweight window manager which makes extensive use of keyboard shortcuts and consumes very little screen real estate.

## Legal Information

locwm is licensed under the same license as the upstream code it is based on.

The ASCII art logo at the top was made using [FIGlet](http://www.figlet.org/).
